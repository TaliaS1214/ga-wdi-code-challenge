## README

This is my solution for General Assembly's WDI Instructor Code Challenge. It's a single page app
written using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript with a light Sinatra back-end. It persists
data by writing to a `data.json` file, to which movie data is saved when a user clicks the
"favorite" button.
